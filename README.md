# Computer Security Algorithms

Problems related to computer security. Algorithms written in Python. [Follow the Tutorial](https://id0-rsa.pub/)

### Topics

* **PGP:** PGP stands for [*Pretty Good Privacy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). Is a program used to facilitate encrypt and decrypt your mail. PGP "has proven itself quite capable of resisting even the most sophisticated forms of analysis" ([PGP faqs](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/pgp-faq/part1/))

* **RSA:** RSA stands for [*Rivest-Shamir-Adleman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)). Is a widely used public-key cryptosystem "based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers" ([RSA cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)))

* **Hashing:** A [*hash function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) maps data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. An [ideal hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) maps randomly, avoid colissions and is impossible to invert.
